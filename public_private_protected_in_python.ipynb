        "Python, by design, does not have strict enforcement of “private” or “protected” visibility like some other languages (e.g. Java or C++). Instead, Python developers rely on naming conventions (single underscore _ or double underscore __) and sometimes property getters/setters to indicate or simulate restricted access.\n",

        "Static methods are methods that belong to a class but don't have access to the instance (self) or the class (cls).\n",
        "They are essentially functions that are logically grouped within a class because they relate to the class's functionality.\n",
        "They are used when a method doesn't need to access any instance-specific or class-specific data.\n",
        "When to Use:\n",
        "When you have a utility function that logically belongs to a class but doesn't require access to the instance's state or the class's state.\n",
        "For helper functions that perform calculations or operations related to the class.\n",

        "They are often used as factory methods to create instances of the class.\n",
        "When to Use:\n",
        "When you need to perform operations that involve the class itself, rather than a specific instance.\n",
        "To create alternative constructors (factory methods) that create instances of the class in different ways.\n",
        "To access or modify class variables.\n",
